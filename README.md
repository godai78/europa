# Europa rescue!

International Satellite Base „Europa” stopped responding and went dark. The general calls you personally and wants you on a rescue mission on the dead space station. Now you have to restore the power, repair defunct devices, and do other maintenance tasks to make “Europa” this extra shiny star on the European sky again. And be sure there are surprises hidden in cargo crates and experiments bay, high, high in Earth’s low orbit. 

Feel the thrill of space adventure in this space station simulator with point-and-click elements from the science-fiction writer, Bartek Biedrzycki, loosely based on the novel “Half the Sky” and the real-life events on the Soviet space station Salyut 7.  

This game is in the later stages of development and as such may still malfunction.
