# Europa rescue!

_Europa rescue!_ is a Game Boy game based on a short novel by me, title "Half the Sky", published 2020 in the "The Cold Starlight" collection of stories. It tells the history of Gloria Dobrowolska, the first Polish female cosmonaut, and colonel Liu Yuxi, a Chinese taikonaut, struggling to repair a defunct space station Europa. The story was based on the events of the rescue mission on Salyut 7 in the '80s.

This game is in the early stages of development and as such may malfunction more than the Europa station herself.
